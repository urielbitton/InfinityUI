Documentation
Infinity UI is a modern and new UI designed with the focus of modern responsive web development & design. Since today mobile devices are more popular than their larger counterparts, the UI library, which indludes a CSS and JS library, is built primarily for mobile devices first and secondly adapted for larger screens. 

*Html content should go into the main parent div "iui-grid" which is for mobile view
*iui-grid-large is designed for larger devices, laptops, desktops, etc.
*Every class in InfinityUI has the prefix "iui-"

If you want to remove all styles from a specific element add class "iui-remove-styles" (this class is handled by jquery which removes all the styling using the removeattr function)

All colors are carefully chosen from popular website color styles so your website's look stays contemporary and vibrant
